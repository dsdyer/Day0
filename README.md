Day0
====
On the 0th day, God gave man Nand. And it was good.

And man said, "x Nand x". And there was Not.

And man said, "not x Nand not y". And there was Or.

And man said, "Not ((not x) Or (not y))". And there was And.

And man took And, Or, and Not in his hands, and rose. And with them, he looked out at the darkness and the unformed chaos.

And man said, "Hello, world."
